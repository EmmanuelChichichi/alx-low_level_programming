## Description
The programs in this project demonstrate how to work with files in C using the standard I/O library functions, such as ```fopen()```, ```fgets()```, ```fprintf()```, and ```fclose()```. These functions are used to open files, read data from them, write data to them, and close them when finished.

## Files
The following files are included in this project:
* 0-read_textfile.c: This program reads and prints the contents of a text file to the standard output.
* 1-create_file.c: This program creates a new file and writes a given string to it.
* 2-append_text_to_file.c: This program appends a given string to the end of a text file.
* 3-cp.c: This program copies the contents of one file to another file.

## Usage
To use these programs, simply compile the source code files using a C compiler such as ```gcc```, and then run the resulting executable files. The programs take command-line arguments as input, such as the names of the files to open or create, and the data to write to them.
