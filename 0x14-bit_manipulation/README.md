# Description
Bit manipulation is a fundamental concept in computer science and programming. It allows us to perform operations on individual bits of data, which is often necessary in various applications such as data compression, cryptography, and network protocols.

In this project, you will learn how to use bitwise operators to perform operations on binary data. You will learn how to set, clear, toggle, and get individual bits, as well as how to shift bits left and right. You will also learn how to use bitwise operators to perform logical operations such as AND, OR, and XOR.

# Learning objectives
###### By completing this project, you will learn:

* What are bitwise operators and how to use them
* What are the common bitwise manipulation techniques
* How to work with binary numbers and hexadecimal notation
* How to write efficient code using bitwise operations

# Requirements
###### To complete this project, you will need:

* A computer running a Linux-based operating system
* The GCC compiler and the standard C library installed on your system
* A text editor or an IDE to write C code
* A basic understanding of C programming language and data types

# Tasks
###### The project consists of several tasks, each of which focuses on a specific aspect of bit manipulation. Each task has a set of requirements and constraints that you must follow to successfully complete it. The tasks are organized as follows:

* 0-binary_to_uint.c
* 1-print_binary.c
* 2-get_bit.c
* 3-set_bit.c
* 4-clear_bit.c
* 5-flip_bits.c

# How to use
###### to compile and run the first task, you can use the following commands:

```$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic```
```$ ./a.out```
